# Deep Learning on Shallow Hardware

Code and information repo for ["Deep Learning on Shallow Hardware Project"](https://github.com/deepseattle/projects/blob/master/DeepLearningOnShallowHardware.md) group of the [Seattle Deep Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Deep-Learning-Meetup/)


Main.py is almost identical to the code from https://github.com/mzaradzki/neuralnets/tree/master/vgg_faces_keras to test a pretrained celebrity facial recognition model

To find the closes celebrity match to a user supplied image, updated the path in line 222
