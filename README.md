# Deep Learning on Shallow Hardware

Code and information repo for ["Deep Learning on Shallow Hardware Project"](https://github.com/deepseattle/projects/blob/master/DeepLearningOnShallowHardware.md) group of the [Seattle Deep Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Deep-Learning-Meetup/)


Main.py is almost identical to the code from [m.zaradzki's repo](https://github.com/mzaradzki/neuralnets/tree/master/vgg_faces_keras) to test a pretrained VGGFace model on celebrities in Keras . This [article](https://aboveintelligent.com/face-recognition-with-keras-and-opencv-2baf2a83b799) explains the repo and code.

To find the closest celebrity match to a user supplied image, updated the path in line 222 of Main.py
